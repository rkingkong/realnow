    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">RealNow — Global Disaster Tracker &middot; Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>RealNow is a real-time disaster monitoring application. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>No personal data is required to use RealNow.</strong> You do not need to create an account or provide any personal information to access the app's core features.</p>
    <p><strong>Anonymous preferences:</strong> If you customize your settings (map style, language, enabled layers), these are stored locally on your device and optionally synced to our server using an anonymous UUID cookie. No personally identifiable information is associated with these preferences.</p>
    <p><strong>Watch area location:</strong> If you set a watch area for proximity alerts, the geographic coordinates are stored locally on your device and optionally synced to our server with your anonymous preferences. This is not your personal location — it is a point on the map you choose to monitor.</p>
    <p><strong>Email address:</strong> If you voluntarily provide an email address for the digest feature, it is stored on our server associated with your anonymous UUID and used solely to send disaster summary emails at your chosen frequency. You can remove it at any time from the app settings.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect your name, phone number, physical address, IP address logs, device identifiers, browsing history, contacts, photos, or any other personal data. We do not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Data Sources</h2>
    <p>RealNow displays disaster data from the following public sources: USGS, NASA FIRMS, GDACS, NOAA, and ReliefWeb. These agencies have their own privacy policies. RealNow does not share any user data with these agencies.</p>

    <h2>Map Tiles</h2>
    <p>The interactive map uses tile services from OpenStreetMap, Esri, and Stamen/Stadia. When you view the map, your device requests map images directly from these tile servers. These services may log standard web request data (such as IP addresses) according to their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
    <p>Anonymous preference data is stored on a Redis database on our server infrastructure hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). All data transmission uses HTTPS encryption. No payment information is ever collected or stored.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>RealNow is a general-audience app and does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. Since no personal data is required to use the app, no age-specific data collection occurs.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can clear all locally stored preferences by clearing your browser or app data. If you have provided an email for the digest feature, you can remove it from the app settings at any time. Since we use anonymous UUIDs, we cannot identify individual users in our database.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@realnow.com">privacy@realnow.com</a></p>
